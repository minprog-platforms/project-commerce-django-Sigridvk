- Add or remove items to/from watchlist
- Owner of a listing can close this listing


## Getting Started

Run the following command in your terminal:
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

- 'Create Listing' button: takes the user to a page where they can make a new listing
- 'Watchlist' button: takes the user to their watchlist

### Default screen

- 'Register' or 'Register here' button: a register form appears on the default screen where the user can give a username, email address and password
- If the user clicks on one of the active listings on the page, they are taken to the page of that specific listing.

### Active Listing Screen
- 'Place Bid' button: confirms the bid the user filled in. The user stays on the page.

### Create Listing Screen

## Models - Class Diagram
Underneath is the Class Diagram for this project. All the models used in this project are shown in the diagram. Underneath the names of the models, all the information we want to save in our database is listed. The arrows show the relationships between the different models.

## Database information usage
